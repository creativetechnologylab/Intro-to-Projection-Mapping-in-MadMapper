2. **Launch MadMapper**

   - On the right, youâ€™ll see preloaded images and animations. Double-click one to load it.

   - A rectangle with your texture will appear in the main viewer area. Adjust the corners to align with your physical object.  
   - Right-click and select â†’ **Add Warping Point** to add more corners.  

Note: MadMapper isnâ€™t an editing program, but you can:  
     - Resize, rotate or scale textures.  
     - Adjust colors in the Settings tab using **Color Controls**.

## Part 2: Uploading Your Own Media & Masking

1. **Upload Your Own Content**  
   - In the media list on the right side of the interface, click the **+** icon to add images or videos. You can also select live inputs (e.g. webcam, Unreal Engine stream).  
   - Double-click your file's name to load it onto the viewer.  
   - Create a new shape using the **Rectangle**, **Circle** or **Triangle** tool to project it.  

2. **Masking Complex Shapes**  
   - For irregular objects, click the **Mask tool** on the left hand side of the interface.

   - Draw the outline of your object directly on the laptop screen while looking at your projection.  
   - Press **Enter** to close the shape.   
   Note: Masks are **layers** added on top of shapes (they won't work on their own).  
   - You can now move the whole mask, edit points or add warping points.  
   - In the **Settings tab**, you can **Invert** the mask or add **Feathering** to soften the mask edges.
